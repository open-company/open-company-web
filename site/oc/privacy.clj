      [:p "This Privacy Policy describes OpenCompany's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. OpenCompany receives your information through our Carrot web site, APIs, services and third parties (\"Services\"). When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by OpenCompany in the United States or any other country where OpenCompany operates."]
      [:h2 "Information Collection and Use"]
      [:p [:i "We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time."]]
      [:p "Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or modify an OpenCompany account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, email address, and password. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with the Service, improving the content of the Service, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features."]
      [:p "Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Service, OpenCompany automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Identifying Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. OpenCompany only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how OpenCompany Users, collectively, use our Service, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service."]
      [:p "We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other OpenCompany Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Services are being used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions."]
      [:p "We also use your Personal Information to contact you with OpenCompany newsletters, marketing materials, and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your \"user profile\" information. Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications."]
      [:p "Log Data"]
      [:p "When you visit the Service, whether as a OpenCompany User or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a \"OpenCompany User\"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (\"Log Data\"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Service, pages of our Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Service, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service and for the Service's technical administration, to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.

Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by OpenCompany Users and web traffic routing on the Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Service may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service."]
      [:p "Web Beacons"]

This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns."]

The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other Services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them."]
